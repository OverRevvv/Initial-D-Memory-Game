# Initial-D-Memory-Game
## Just a card flipping memory game, where Initial D images are used, whole game is made from vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Not Fully completed yet.

### How to try this game.
- Click on the link below.
- If the images are not loaded kindly click on on the image icons manually, there are total 12 cover images.
- When the images loads up you need click on 1 image then click on anotehr, basically you have to find the matching image.
- When you find the right pair the matched images will be discarded and it'll left a blank space.
- Now you have to find all the pairs in order to complete the game.
- Every time you reloads the tab, the order of images will be changed.


### Changes that will be done soon.
- Fix for image loading.
- Better Pop-Ups (Won't use your browser pop-ups).
- Few more changes and improvement that i might do depending on the ideas.
